This was my project for the training project work at the University of Technology and Economics.
The goal af the project was, if a WGAN (which uses Pokemon as dataset) could be improved, if the dataset is broaden by augmentation.
The base project is this: https://github.com/kkahloots/Generative_Models
My work is also documented, it is included in this project.
